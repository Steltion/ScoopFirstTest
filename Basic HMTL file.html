META TAG
Metadata is data (information) about data.
Tips and Notes
Note: <meta> tags always go inside the <head> element.

Note: Metadata is always passed as name/value pairs.
Don't have to be close (in html4 it was mandatory)
Note: The content attribute MUST be defined if the name 
or the http-equiv attribute is defined. If none of these are
 defined, the content attribute CANNOT be defined.

The <meta> tag provides metadata about the HTML document. Metadata will not be displayed on the page, 
but will be machine parsable. Meta elements are typically used to specify page description, keywords,
 author of the document, last modified, and other metadata. The metadata can be used by browsers 
 (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), or other web services.HTML5 introduced 
 a method to let web designers take control over the viewport (the user's visible area of a web page),
  through the <meta> tag (See "Setting The Viewport" example below).

    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <!--
Common HTML Character Sets

The default character set in HTML 4 was 8859-1.

The default character set in HTML 5 is UTF-8.

Setting The Viewport

HTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the viewport, through the <meta> tag.

The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device, and will be smaller
 on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

You should include the following <meta> viewport element in all your web pages:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
A <meta> viewport element gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device 
(which will vary depending on the device).

The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

Here is an example of a web page without the viewport meta tag, and the same web page with the viewport meta tag:
